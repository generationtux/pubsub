# Google PubSub for Laravel & Lumen

## TODO

* Switch the package name to Bugle.
* Repair the config - move it out from under queue
* Turn Google into a driver - make the API generic for another pub sub provider?
* Test it end to end again inside the testscontroller
* What is the test coverage?
* Write the readme for setting up pub sub from scratch using gcloud
